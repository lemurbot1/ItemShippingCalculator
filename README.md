This purpose of this code is to help the user determine the cost of shipping an item depending on the cost of the item, the destination, and whether or not the item is fragile. A nested if structure is used to deduce the shipping cost depending on the destination entered by the user. Following that is a switch/case structure to determine if an extra fee needs to be added for a fragile item. From there, the code does simple addition to find the sum of the item with shipping costs and the possible fragile item fee. It also capitalizes both strings from the user's input for the output. The shipping cost and total cost of shipping with the fragile item fee and the cost of the item itself added all together are outputted as well.

Submitted here to GitHub is a slightly modified code with another destination added: Pluto. Of course, the cost of this shipping would be astronomical, which is why I decided on $3,000.00 for shipping for items under $50, then $6,000.00 for the next level, then $12,000.00.
